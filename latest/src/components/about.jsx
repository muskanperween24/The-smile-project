              <h2>Why We Are Doing This</h2>
              <p>
                We believe that every child deserves education, care, and
                opportunity. Many children in rural and low-income communities
                struggle due to a lack of resources and guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The Project Smile</strong> works to provide education support,
                mentorship, and skill development to children and youth â€” helping
                them build confidence and live better lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our purpose is to promote{" "}
                <strong>innovative, sustainable, and community-owned models</strong> that
                bring lasting social and human impact. Together, we aim to create a
                society where every child can learn, grow, and smile.
